# Simple home tab

It is a simple but quite different from the normal home tabs used in browsers. Written using simple `HTML`,`CSS` and `Javascript`

## Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ankitdey-marsh/HomeTab.git
```
Simply set the `index.html` file as the home tab from the 'Settings' of your browser.

## Configuration
The image used can be easily changed by changing the link used in `Line 9` of `Styles.css` file. The icons used in the hometab can be changed by customizing the `app.js`. To add more tiles, simply add the icons, and link of the website. Removing them is just as easy, simply remove the code of the tile that is not required.
